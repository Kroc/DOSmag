^-

Final DOOM is a pair of standalone Doom II modifications, TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment, which include full sets of new levels, some new graphics and textures and some new music in the former case, in addition to most of the resources from Doom and Doom II. It was published on June 17, 1996 by id Software under the initiative of John Romero and developed by members of the fan community belonging to TeamTNT.

Evilution has a much more technical theme with levels that are akin to real buildings, versus Plutonia, whose floor design tends more toward a natural landscape feel.
